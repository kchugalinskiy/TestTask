0. known bugs: http://localhost:8080 will return non-standard 404. This is some yaws issue.

1.
make build - build binaries
make runtest - build binaries + run UTs
make deb - build deb file
make configure - copy yaws configuration scripts
make docker - build docker container named 'ttask'. Warning - requires root rights for docker service
make clean - clean all generated files

2. Before running - please run make configure once!
To run install generated deb package and execute script by running command
test_task
or start yaws as a service:
service yaws start

3. If running under docker, just 'make docker' it and then run as you usually run docker commands
For instance I used command
sudo docker run -i -p 8080 --name inst ttask
